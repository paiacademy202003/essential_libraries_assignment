"""
Write a function that takes a path to a text file as input and returns a pandas dataframe consisting of the entries in the text file. The elements in the
text file will be space separated, and the data in the file will not have a column header. The column names of the returned dataframe should take the form
column_1, column_2, ..... , column_N where N is the number of columns in the dataset. For example there is a file in this repository called test_data.txt.
Depending on where in your computer you downloaded the repository, there will be a specific path to that file which you can save to a string called path.
Then, f(path) should return the dataframe,

         column_1  column_2 column_3
    0        a         1        i
    1        b         2       ii
    2        c         3      iii
    3        d         4       iv
    4        e         5        v
