Write a function that takes a path to a csv file as input. It will load this file into a pandas dataframe. This dataset is assumed to have a column called 'Class'.
We are going to create a classification model from scikit-learn to try to predict this class column. This function will need to take the following steps,

* Load the csv file specified in the path to a pandas dataframe.
* Remove all rows with missing values.
* Split the data into a training set and testing set with the sklearn train_test_split() method
(see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html). y is the 'Class' column, and X is all of the other columns. Use
a test_size of 0.3, and a random_state of 0. These values are important for when the assignment is graded.
* Initialize a scikit-learn logistic regression model and fit the model to the training set data.
(see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html). Do not specify any hyperparameters.
* Return the classification score when predicted on the testing set data with the score() method.

There is a file called breast-cancer-wisconsin.csv in this repo (slightly modified from the original dataset in the UCI machine learning repository). Running f(path)
where path is the path to this csv file should return a score somewhere between 0.9 and 0.95.
