Write a function that takes a pandas dataframe, df as input. df is assumed to have a column called 'text' where each entry is a block of text.
The function should return all the rows in df where the number of words in the 'text' entry is greater than or equal to 10. Hint: it is possible
to define a function within another function and then use that function locally. There is a csv file called testdf9.csv. Loading this as a
dataframe and running f(df) should return
