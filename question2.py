Write a function that takes a one dimensional numpy array and returns an array that is the Z scores of all the elements in the
original array. Say arr is a one dimensional array. The Z score of arr[i] is arr[i] minus the mean of arr, all divided by the
standard deviation of arr, or (arr[i] - mean(arr)) / stdev(arr). Suppose arr = array([1,2,3,4,5,6]). Then f(a) should return
array([-1.46385011, -0.87831007, -0.29277002,  0.29277002,  0.87831007, 1.46385011]). Taking the Z score of a column of data is
a common way of normalizing the values in a dataset.
